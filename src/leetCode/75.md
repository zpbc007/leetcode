# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note:
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

## 只有三种数字的数组排序

遍历数组，将值为0的放到数组最前端，值为2的放到数组最末尾。指针最开始指向数组尾部，每次遇到2将指针向前移动一位，当i与指针相遇时，排序结束。
